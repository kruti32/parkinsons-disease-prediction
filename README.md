# Parkinsons-disease-prediction
Comparative analysis of supervised and unsupervised ML models for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease diagnosis.
TL;DR
This project compares supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods for diagnosing Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using the Kaggle Parkinson's dataset. It identifies which model performs best and how unsupervised methods can enhance data understanding.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
Compared models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, K-Means, PCA

Supervised models outperformed unsupervised in prediction accuracy

Used CRISP-DM methodology for a structured data science process

Feature engineering and normalization enhanced performance

Visualized PCA clusters and model performance (RÂ², MSE)
